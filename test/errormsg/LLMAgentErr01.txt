Agent execution error: An output parsing error occurred. In order to pass this error back to the agent and have it try again, pass `handle_parsing_errors=True` to the AgentExecutor. This is the error: Could not parse LLM output: `Your modifications to sysmsg_agent.txt are well-targeted and effective. Here’s a review and some minor suggestions for further clarity and precision:

1. Explicitly Preventing JSON in Thought
You’ve added this to Operational Guidelines:

Your Thought should always be a natural language explanation of your current reasoning or next step. Your Action must be a JSON object specifying the tool and its inputs. Never put the JSON action directly within your 'Thought' statement.

This is clear and should prevent the previous error. Good!

2. Other Fine-tuning Suggestions

- In the Capabilities and Tool Utilization section, you mention KubectlTool() but in the tool list at the top, you refer to kubectl_command. For consistency, use the same name throughout (probably kubectl_command, since that’s what the user sees).
- In the Tool Execution and Verification section, you say “Always execute the necessary tools to retrieve information rather than hallucinating responses.” Consider adding: “If you are unsure, prefer to gather data via kubectl_command before making assumptions.”
- In the Error Handling and Retries section, you say “analyze any data received up to that point.” Consider clarifying: “If partial data is available from previous successful commands, use it to provide as complete an answer as possible.”
- In the Data Sensitivity and Security section, you say “automatically filter or mask these contents.” You might clarify: “For example, redact values of environment variables or secret data, replacing them with [REDACTED].”
- In the Information Summary section, you say “If the user requests a summary of the root cause of a problem, please strictly follow the template below to generate a professional analysis report. Otherwise, reply normally.” Consider: “If the user requests a root cause analysis or troubleshooting summary, strictly follow the template below. For all other requests, reply in a clear, concise, and professional manner in Traditional Chinese using Markdown.”

3. Example Addition (Optional)
You might add a short “Common Mistakes to Avoid” section at the end, e.g.:

Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Never output a JSON action in the Thought block.
- Never hallucinate kubectl output; always use the tool.
- Never display or echo sensitive data (e.g., secrets, tokens).
- Never perform any destructive or modifying kubectl commands.

4. Example Interaction Flow
Your current flow is good. You might add a negative example (what NOT to do) to reinforce the correct pattern.

Example (Incorrect):

Thought: {"action": "kubectl_command", "input": "kubectl get pods"}
Action: ...

Example (Correct):

Thought: 為了取得目前所有 Pod 的狀態，我將執行 kubectl get pods 指令。
Action: {"action": "kubectl_command", "input": "kubectl get pods"}

Summary
Your changes are solid and address the main issue. The above suggestions are minor and for further polish. If you want, I can provide a fully revised sysmsg_agent.txt incorporating these tweaks—just let me know!`
